# Only Good Reads

A Goodreads review filter that shows only 4 and 5 star reviews for any book. Paste a Goodreads book URL and the app scrapes and displays only positive reviews, filtering out negativity for readers who want encouragement before starting a new book. Features pagination through reviews and displays book cover art alongside reviewer information. Built with Next.js as a fun experiment in web scraping and a personal antidote to getting discouraged by critical reviews.
